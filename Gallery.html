                        <p>This is the first game I worked on called On Thin Ice! it is a free for all game where you and some other people are stranded on a glacier and waiting to be rescued. We focused on a last man standing type of theme were you basically sabotage people, by melting their ice that they are standing on. There are benefit cards, disadvantage cards and story. We did work on a team mode but scrapped it. I mainly worked on mechanics, story lines and some of the ideas for the benefit and disadvantage cards.</p>

                        <p>This game is called in the city. I worked on this game by myself no other help. Mechanics, Rules, Characters, Storyline all done by me. It is mystery game about a girl who goes missing after seeing a medium and you have to find out what happened to her through a series of clues, I am hoping to make this into a physical game with the help of gamecarfters.</p>

                        <p>This is a playtest video of the very last game I made this semester, we actually didn't name this game but it is a party game where you hit a d20 back and forth trying to get the most points. We also had zones where you could gain x2 point or you could get a punishment. I did mechanics, some of the punishments, the rule book, so much playtesting in only one class. It is a very fun game though.</p>

                        <p>These were the zones for the game red zone is x4 points, orange zone is x3, yellow is x2 and the three different shades of blue are the punishment zones.</p>
